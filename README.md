## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned how to make a theme switcher using css classes and, especially, how to make a gradient color on a div border (in this case to keep Instagram brand colors as a border).
The use of pseudo elements was also a good training.
